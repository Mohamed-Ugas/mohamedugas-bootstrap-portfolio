making a portfolio using bootstrap

## I had to make a portfolio using bootstrap with the following items
A navigation bar

A navigation menu at the top. 

Include links that are applicable to your portfolio.

Links should navigate to the appropriate sections

A hero section

A jumbotron featuring my picture, my name, and any other information I would like to include.

A work section

A section displaying my work in grid.

Use Bootstrap cards for each project.

The description should give a brief overview of my work.

A skills section

List out the skills I expect to learn from the bootcamp.
An about/contact section

An About Me section in the same row.
A footer section

All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.

All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.

## My experience making the webpage
It was a bit complicated and also could not get my css file to work, so I used a lot of inline styling on the html file
